# MEAN Stack Deployment to Ubuntu in AWS
Now, when you have already learned how to deploy **LAMP**, **LEMP** and **MERN** Web stacks - it is time to get yourself familiar with MEAN stack and deploy it to Ubuntu server.

### MEAN Stack is a combination of following components:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Document database) - Stores and allows to retrieve data.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (Back-end application framework) - Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) (Front-end application framework) - Handles Client and Server Requests
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (JavaScript runtime environment) - Accepts requests and displays results to end user

In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.
